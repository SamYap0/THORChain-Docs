# Roles

In the THORChain ecosystem, there are four key roles that network participants may play:

1. **Liquidity providers**: these add liquidity to pools, earning fees for their temporary deposit
2. **Swappers**: those users who use THORChain's liquidity to swap assets ad-hoc, paying fees for the service
3. **Arbitrageurs**: expert traders who continually monitor and rebalance pools; still paying fees but with the intent to earn a profit
4. **Node Operators** who provide a bond and are paid to secure the system.

A single user may take on multiple roles simultaneously.
